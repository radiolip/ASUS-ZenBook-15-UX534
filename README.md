After getting familiar with Mac OS Catalina, you should completely remove it from your Windows laptop.

Note: before installing Mac OS on your laptop, backup copy of your - OEM Windows 10. If you want to return to it in the future. Installing retail Windows 10 from the Microsoft website, there is no guarantee that you will be able to use the ASUS ScreenXpert (Screenpad 2.0) and Alexa branded apps.

ASUS: The OEM version of Windows is pre installed from factory. The versions downloaded from Microsoft would be retail copies and would not be specific to any manufacturer. The OEM version of Windows can only be reloaded by service center.
